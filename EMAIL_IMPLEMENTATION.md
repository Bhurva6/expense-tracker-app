- **Transport**: Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- **Authentication**: Gmail App Passwords (secure)
- **Templates**: HTML with inline CSS for compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with console logging
- **Location Integration**: Geographic data included in notifications

### Integration Points
1. **ExpenseForm.tsx**: Calls `sendNewExpenseNotification()` after successful submission
2. **AdminDashboard.tsx**: Calls `sendStatusChangeNotification()` on status updates
3. **AdminDashboard.tsx**: Calls `sendExpenseClosedNotification()` when closing expenses

### Environment Variables
```bash
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com              # Gmail account for sending
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop       # 16-character app password
```

### Gmail Limits
- **Daily**: 500 emails per day (regular Gmail)
- **Rate**: ~100 emails per minute
- **Upgrade**: Use Gmail Workspace for higher limits

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Authentication failed"** → Check Gmail credentials and App Password
2. **"Emails not received"** → Check spam folder and recipient addresses
3. **"Service unavailable"** → Check internet connection and Gmail status

### Testing Tools
- `testEmailConfiguration()` - Verify Gmail connection
- `runEmailTests()` - Comprehensive email testing
- Admin Dashboard Email Test Component - UI-based testing

### Debug Mode
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
DEBUG=nodemailer
NODE_ENV=development
```
