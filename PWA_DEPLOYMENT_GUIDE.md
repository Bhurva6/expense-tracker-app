## 📦 Creating an APK (Android Package)

Since this is a PWA, you can create a native Android APK using TWA (Trusted Web Activity):

### Method 1: Using PWABuilder (Easiest)
1. Go to [PWABuilder.com](https://pwabuilder.com)
2. Enter your deployed PWA URL
3. Click "Build My PWA"
4. Select "Android" and download the APK
5. You can publish this APK to Google Play Store

### Method 2: Using Bubblewrap CLI
```bash
# Install Bubblewrap
npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli

# Initialize TWA project
bubblewrap init --manifest=https://yourapp.com/manifest.json

# Build APK
bubblewrap build

# Generated APK will be in the app/build/outputs/apk/ folder
```

### Method 3: Manual TWA Setup
1. Clone the [TWA Template](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa)
2. Update the `twa-manifest.json` with your app details
3. Build using Android Studio

## 🏪 Publishing to App Stores

### Google Play Store (Android):
1. Generate APK using one of the methods above
2. Create a Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee)
3. Upload APK and fill app details
4. Submit for review

### Apple App Store (iOS):
Unfortunately, PWAs cannot be directly packaged for iOS App Store. However:
1. Users can still install the PWA via Safari
2. Consider using React Native or Capacitor for native iOS app

## 🔒 PWA Security Features

- **HTTPS Required**: PWAs only work over HTTPS
- **Service Worker Security**: All cached content is secure
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Follows web security standards
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks

## 📊 PWA Analytics

To track PWA installations and usage:

1. Add Google Analytics or your preferred analytics
2. Track PWA-specific events:
   - `beforeinstallprompt` shown
   - App installed
   - App launched from home screen
   - Offline usage

## 🛠️ Customization

### Update App Colors:
Edit `/public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "theme_color": "#22c55e",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

### Add New Icons:
1. Replace source image in `/public/panache_green_logo.jpeg`
2. Run `npm run generate-icons`
3. Rebuild with `npm run build-pwa`

### Modify Caching Strategy:
Edit caching rules in `/next.config.ts`:
```javascript
runtimeCaching: [
  // Add your custom caching rules here
]
```
